---

chibivue is minimal [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core) implementations.  
(Reactivity System, Virtual DOM and Patch Rendering, Component System, Template Compiler, SFC Compiler)

"`chibi`" means "`small`" in Japanese.

This project began in February 2023 with the goal of simplifying the understanding of Vue's core implementation.

Currently, I am still in the process of implementation, but after implementation, I intend to post explanatory articles as well.

(For now, I plan to post Japanese first.)

# 👜 Package Manager

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager.

And use [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni) .

```sh
# if you don't have ni yet
npm i -g @antfu/ni
```

## 🎉 Bonus Track

This is bonus track on writing Vue.js in 15 minutes because chibivue has gotten so big.

This chapter implements createApp / virtual dom / patch / reactivity / template compiler / sfc compiler in just 110 lines of source code.

The title is "**Hyper Ultimate Super Extreme Minimal Vue - writing Vue.js on 15 minutes**"
