    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello Chibi-vue!</p>

    <p>
      chibivue is minimal Vue.js v3 core implementations (reactivity, vnode,
      component, compiler). "chibi" means "small" in Japanese.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project began in February 2023 with the goal of simplifying the
      understanding of Vue's core implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I am still in the process of implementation, but after
      implementation, I intend to post explanatory articles as well.
    </p>

    <p>(For now, I plan to post Japanese first.)</p>
